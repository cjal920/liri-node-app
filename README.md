LIRI


WHAT I DO

Greetings, user. My name is LIRI. I have been programmed to provide you with detailed information about virtually any song or movie you may be interested in knowing more about using the following commands:

  For songs: node liri.js spotify-this-song "<your song title here>"
  For movies: node liri.js movie-this "<your movie title>"
  
Failure to specify a song or movie title after each of these generic commands will return song and movie title defaults "The Sign" by Ace of Base and "Mr. Nobody", respectively. 

For fans of the Backstreet Boys and/or all those who sought to mock or imitate them, I have a very special command line that returns information about their 1990s classic "I Want It That Way." That command line reads as follows:

  node liri.js do-what-it-says

I have one final command that enables you, gentle user, to read my last 20 tweets under my alter-ego HAL 9000. For those of you who may be unfamiliar with me, please enter the following command line: 

  node liri.js movie-this 2001
  

HOW I DO IT
